.SH NAME
sfcbd \- Open Source Small-Footprint CIM Broker (sfcb)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sfcbd
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
sfcb is a lightweight CIM daemon (aka CIMOM) that responds to CIM client
requests for system management data and/or performs system management 
tasks. sfcb supports most of the standard CIM XML over http/https protocol.
It is highly modular, allowing functionality to be easily added, removed
or customized for different management applications. sfcb is specifically
targetted for small embedded system that do not have the available CPU,
memory or disk resources to support a full-blown enterprise-level CIMOM.
That said, sfcb runs very well on a regular Linux/Unix system and supports
most of the functions required by CIM clients to manage such the system. 
Supported CIM operations include:
.IP
.TS
l l.	
GetClass
EnumerateClasses
EnumerateClassNames
GetInstance
DeleteInstance
CreateInstance
ModifyInstance
EnumerateInstances
EnumerateInstanceNames
InvokeMethod (MethodCall)
ExecQuery
Associators
AssociatorNames
References
ReferenceNames
.TE
.PP
CIM process and lifecycle indications (aka 'events') are also supported.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Supported command line options are:
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Specify an alternative configuration file. 
Default=\fI@sysconfdir@/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\fR
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemon\fR
Run sfcbd (and child processes) in the background.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-collect-stats\fR
Turn on runtime statistics collecting. If enabled then
various sfcbd runtime statistics will be written to \fI./sfcbStat\fR.
Default is no statistics are collected.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-trace-components\fR=\fINUM\fR
Activate component-level tracing messages, where \fINUM\fR is an
OR-ed bitmask integer defining which component to trace.
Specifying "-t ?" will list all the components and their
associated integer bitmask.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints version information and exits.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.PP
sfcbd reads the configuration file \fI@sysconfdir@/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\fR (or
the file specified with the -c option) at start up. The configuration file 
contains \fIoption : value\fR pairs, one per line. sfcb recogonizes the 
following configuration file options
.TP
.B httpPort
Local port that sfcbd should listen to receive HTTP (i.e. insecure)
requests from CIM clients. Default=\fI5988\fR
.TP
.B enableHttp
Whether sfcb should accept HTTP client connections. Default=\fItrue\fR.
.TP
.B httpProcs
Maximum number of simultaneous HTTP client connections before
blocking new incoming HTTP requests. Default=\fI8\fR
.TP
.B httpsPort
Local port that sfcbd should listen to receive HTTPS (i.e. secure)
requests from CIM clients. Default=\fI5989\fR
.TP
.B enableHttps
Whether sfcb should accept HTTPS client connections. Default=\fIfalse\fR.
.TP
.B httpsProcs
Maximum number of simultaneous HTTPS client connections before
blocking new incoming HTTPS requests. Default=\fI8\fR
.TP
.B enableInterOp
Whether sfcb should provide the interop namespace for indication support.
Default=\fItrue\fR
.TP
.B provProcs
Maximum number of simultaneous SBLIM provider processes. After this
point if a new incoming request requires loading a new provider,
then one of the existing providers will first be automatically
unloaded. Default=\fI32\fR 
.TP
.B doBasicAuth
Perform basic authentication on the client userid (obtained from the
HTTP/HTTPS header) before allowing the request. Default=\fIfalse\fR
(i.e. no client authentication performed).
.TP
.B basicAuthLib
Name of the local library to call to authenticate the client userid.
Default=\fI@libdir@/libsfcBasicAuthentication.la\fR
.TP
.B useChunking
Tell sfcbd to use HTTP/HTTPS 'chunking' to return large volumes of
response data to the client in 'chunks', rather than buffering the 
data and sending it back all at once. Default=\fItrue\fR
.TP
.B keepaliveTimeout
Specify the maximum time in seconds an sfcb HTTP process will wait
between two requests on one connection before terminating. Setting 
it to 0 will disable HTTP keep-alive. Default=\fI0\fR
.TP
.B keepaliveMaxRequest
Specify the maximum number of consecutive request on one connection.
Setting it to 0 will effectively disable HTTP keep-alive. Default=\fI10\fR
.TP
.B registrationDir
Specify the registration directory, which contains the provider
registration data, the staging area and the static repository.
Default=\fI@localstatedir@/lib/sfcb/registration\fR
.TP
.B providerDirs
A space separated list of directories where sfcb is looking for provider
libraries. Default=\fI@libdir@\ @libdir@/cmpi\fR
.TP
.B sslCertificateFilePath
Specify the name of the file containing the server's certificate. 
The file must be in PEM format. This file is only required if 
enableHttps is set to \fItrue\fR. Default=\fI @sysconfdir@/sfcb/server.pem\fR
.TP
.B sslKeyFilePath
Specify the name of the file containing the private key for the
server's certificate. The file must be in PEM format and may not
be passphrase-protected. This file is only required if enableHttps is
set to \fItrue\fR. Default=\fI@sysconfdir@/sfcb/file.pem\fR
.TP
.B sslClientTrustStore
Specify the name of the file containing the either the CA certificate
issuing client certificates or self-signed certificates of the clients.
This file must be in PEM format and is only required if sslClientCertificate
is set to \fIaccept\fR or \fIrequire\fR. Default=\fI@sysconfdir@/sfcb/client.pem\fR
.TP
.B sslClientCertificate
Specify the way sfcb handles client certificate based authentication. If set to
\fIignore\fR it will not request a certificate from the client. If set to
\fIaccept\fR it will request a certificate from the client but not fail if
the client doesn't present one. If set to \fIrequire\fR it will refuse the
client connection if the client doesn't present a certificate. Default=\fIignore\fR
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SFCB_PAUSE_PROVIDER
Specifies the name of the SBLIM provider to pause after first
being loaded to facilitate attaching a runtime debugger to the
provider's process for debugging purposes.
.TP
.B SFCB_PAUSE_CODEC
Specifies the name of the sfcb codec (currently only "http") to pause
after first being started to facilitate attaching a runtime debugger
to the process.
.TP
.B SFCB_TRACE
Specifies the level of trace/debug messages for sfcb.
Valid values are 0 (no trace messages), or 1 (key trace messages only)
to 4 (all messages).
.br
[Note: SFCB_TRACE level is used in conjunction
with sfcb's component-level tracing to control the
level of detail of trace messages to display within each component]
.TP
.B SFCB_TRACE_FILE
By default sfcb trace messages are written to STDERR.
Setting this envorinment variable causes the trace messages to be
written to a file instead.
.TP
.B SFCB_TRAP
If set this environment variable enables trap interrupts on x86
platforms to be generated by sfcb in special situations.
.br
[Note: not currently ever used]
.TP
.B SBLIM_TRACE
Specifies the level of trace/debug messages for SBLIM providers.
Valid values are 0 (no trace messages), or 1 (key trace messages only)
to 4 (all messages).
.br
[Note: this only applies to SBLIM providers written with explicit trace
messages in their source code.]
.TP
.B SBLIM_TRACE_FILE
By default SBLIM provider trace messages are written to STDERR.
Setting this envorinment variable causes the trace messages to be
written to a file instead.
