.TH xmltest 1 "August 2005" "xmltest Version @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
xmltest \- Test script to send CIM-XML (via wbemcat) to CIMOM and compare to known results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmltest
[\fIFILE\fB]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
xmltest is a script that is used to send a raw CIM-XML test file to the sfcb CIMOM 
(using wbemcat) and then compares the returned CIM-XML results against a previously 
determined 'OK' result file to check whether the returned results match the expected
results. If there does not yet exist an 'OK' corresponding to the XML file then xmltest 
will save the returned results as the new OK file for later use. If the
returned CIM-XML results don't match the existing 'OK' file a new 'result' file will be
generated containing the erroneous results.
.PP
If no \fIFILE\fB is specified xmltest will use all files with a .xml extension
in the current directory path.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
If there is no 'OK' file to compare returned CIM-XML results against xmltest will generate one.

erroneous results.

.SH BUGS
Does not adequately deal with additional http headers/footers caused by
chunking responses, which will result in false failures when comparing results
to existing "x.OK" files.
