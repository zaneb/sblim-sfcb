This directory contains the SFCB automated test suite. It is based on the test
facility provided by automake:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Tests

The test suite is invoked via "make check". Currently it requires that 
sfcb is installed and running.

Testcases can be either scripts or C code. Scripts just need to be added
to the TESTS variable in the appropriate place. C code will need to have 
the executable name added to TESTS and check_PROGRAMS. As well as a rule 
created to build it named <executable>_SOURCES.

Testcases should return 0 on success and 1 for failure, the special return 
value of 77 causes the testcase result to be ignored. This feature allows 
tests to be ignored in certain conditions.

Testcases listed in the XFAIL_TESTS variable are ones that are expected to 
fail. Therefore the test results are reversed. 

The environment variable "SFCBTDIR" will be set to the full path of the 
root test directory (sfcb/test) during the test run. 

Any mof files that are placed in the "schema" directory will be added
to the root/cimv2 namespace at sfcb postinstall time.
